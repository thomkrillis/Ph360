Code from Summer 2010 course Physics Simulations in Python at the Cooper Union

This repository consists of code written by me for the course, Ph360 - Physics Simulations in Python, at The Cooper Union during the Summer of 2010.

All code is left as it was submitted at the end of this course and does not fully reflect my skills in programming in Python. This was an introductory course on Python, and my only previous experience had been in creating a Zork, a text-based adventure game, in C the previous Fall.

My final project for the course simulates the superposition of two surface waves and is contained in the yankou\_finalproject\_writter.py and yankou\_finalproject\_plotter.py files. I also included a screenshot to show what the visualization looks like.

Another major project I did was to simulate the Shive Wave Machine, a popular demonstration for Physics Lectures on wave propagation and interference. It is contained in the yankou\_wavemachine\_writer.py and yankou\_wavemachine\_plotter.py files. Videos of the visualization are viewable at http://engfac.cooper.edu/wolf/58 (assuming the link is still good). Note that the code allows the user to rotate the machine; the videos used an isometric view to show the machine from the best perspective.

The file yankou\_cube.py was a test for the rotation of the wave machine.

Feel free to explore the other files as well, which are included for posterity.

WARNING: yankou\_wirebead.py uses system sounds whose pitch correlate to the speed of a bead travelling along a wire.
